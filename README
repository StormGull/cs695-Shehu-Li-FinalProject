Our project files consist of:




Our programs are mostly written in Python 3.x. If you run it as an executable
in Linux it will assume your Python is located in /usr/bin/python3. If
you want to run it with another version of Python in your path (like
/usr/local/bin/python3) then run "python3 a3.py" (this is all basic,
but we're just being complete.)

We tested this program on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python version 3.5.2 and
Windows 10 with Python version 3.4.

The program uses some Python modules that are not installed by default, but are
available from pip: igraph, networkx, numpy, and llist.

We also wrote a C++ program to do the geometry for the 3-connected
technique. It relies primarily on the Wykobi library to perform
geometrical calculations. It also uses the lexical_cast and
property_tree libraries. The version we used for Linux is 1.58
(default package version for Ubuntu 16.04;) and for Windows is
1.68. We also had to hack the Boost property_tree files to get it to
work properly with numbers.

We've checked in all the Wykobi code (and changed Boost files) in the
directory wykobi-master. In Linux, you should be able to

cd wykobi-master
make
make install

For Windows 10 we built the C++ file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
